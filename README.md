#Requisition System

The program I have done is Python-based Requisition Management System that helps in managing staff data including collecting staff information like ID, name, and date, storing requisition information, calculate the cost of items, approving or pending requests, and showing statistics and how a concept of software design principles is implemented and can be improved. I have used K.I.S.S principles in staff_information method in the code because it makes the program simple and straight forward so that the user only has to input the date, staff ID and staff name using input functions then it will print the contents and a unique requisition ID which makes the program simple and easy to understand.
In the requisitions_details method, which gather information like item names and costs and calculates the total cost, unfortunately it combines input and calculation and display. So, in the future I will used Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) that helps to separate the input, calculation, and display into three distinct functions hence making the code cleaner, easy to maintain and easy to extend. 
In the requisition_approval method, it approves requisitions when the total price is less than 500, and leaves others in the pending state but it violates the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) because, changing approval rules would require modifying existing code. so, in the future,open/closed principles can be applied by creating the separate function for approval rules so the system can extend criteria without changing the main logic.
In the respond_requisition method, the manager has the option of approving or not approving requisitions but this process mixes input handling with status updates. In the future I would use SRP principles that make the code more maintainable and testable. 
The display_requisition method print and display requisition information but repeats information with Staff_information and requisition_approval which is already print before, which is a violation of the DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) principle. In future, I would DRY that helps to implemented by designing a reusable routine to print requisition information rather than repeating it. 
The requisition_statistic technique displays totals of approved, pending and not approved request against a single object but it can be improved by applying Separation of Concerns (SoC) to calculate and record statistics at the system level and hence able to aggregate such statistics across many requisitions. 
overall, the code I have done shows how K.I.S.S helps to keep the program simple and understandable, and my comments and analysis indicate that such principles as SRP, OCP, DRY, and SoC can be used in future to enhance the design and make it more maintainable, extendable, and professional. This project performs as a requisition system and a learning case study, showing the principles of software design used to improved coding to cleaner, more organized, and scalable programs in the future.
